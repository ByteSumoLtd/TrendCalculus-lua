the R code in this release can be run as follows:

#	1. set your working directory in R to where you have the trendcalculus-public folder
	   setwd("~/trendcalculus-public")

#	2. load the R package for trendcalculus into your session. This uses devtools which you may need to install. check the function loaded.
	   load_all("R_tcalc")
	   tc.data.table 

#	3. form a zoo object having just the values of interest. Here I leverage quantmod libs to fetch stock data. 
	   getSymbols("IBM")
	   IBM.Close <- IBM[,4]

#	4. run the function to see output. It produces a data.table. You may need to install it.
	   tc.data.table(IBM.Close)

#	5. save output to a local data table
	   mytst <- tc.data.table(IBM.Close)	
	   str(mytst)
