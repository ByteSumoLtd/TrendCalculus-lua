a note on these tests:

I've just tested embedding lua and compiling it to a c program, and I got it working.
Looking at the test script, I'm seeing (and am quite amazed by it) just using regular luajit runs faster.

I suppose that isn't surprising :-)

Anyway, there are benefits to proving that it can be done, including sorting out building an interface to R and other apps for example.

Feel free to play around with the compilation locally, maybe I got some tuning wrong. 
Your mileage may vary.
